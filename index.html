            <strong>1.Evaluation and Prediction of Climatic parameters based on IoT system using Machine learning and Neural network algorithms.</strong>
            <div class="muted small">Research Square  — 2024/9/11</div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
  This study presents an innovative method for integrating artificial intelligence/machine learning models 
  with an Internet of Things (IoT) system for evaluating, validating and predicting climatic parameters. 
  The prototype IoT system described herein is designed to control demo-satellite power-enabled remotely 
  technologies while simultaneously capturing real-time environmental parameters such as air temperature, 
  humidity, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels.
  <span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    These data are then stored in a dedicated server database. They are capable of interfacing with the 
    Blynk IoT application for seamless remote-control access of the demo-satellite and monitoring environmental conditions 
    parameters. The system demonstrates how ML-based predictive models can forecast temperature fluctuations 
    and CO₂ concentrations, enhancing climate research and sustainability monitoring systems.

            <div class="muted small">ICTACT Journal on Microelectronics(UGC Care)  — 2025/01/6</div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
 This study presents an innovative method to develop an Internet of Things (IoT) system. The prototype IoT system described herein is designed to remotely control demo-satellite power-enabled technologies while capturing real-time environmental parameters such as air temperature, humidity, and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. These data are then stored in a dedicated server database along with timestamps for efficient data management and analysis. The system can be interfaced with the Blynk IoT application for seamless remote-control access of the demo satellite and monitoring environmental parameters. 
  <span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    Moreover, it provides an easy way to visualise stored data through graphical representations, enabling users to track trends and make informed decisions. The system can be expanded to accommodate additional sensors and parameters, further enhancing its functionality for diverse applications in environmental monitoring and remote-control systems, it supports the up to 50m range.

     <strong>3.Comparison of machine learning algorithms for predicting temperature</strong>
            <div class="muted small">Advancing Innovation through AI and Machine Learning Algorithms (Conference)  — 2025/7/1</div>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">
 Weather prediction is vital for daily life and critical applications such as agriculture, disaster management, and climate studies. This 
study aims to enhance air temperature forecasting by evaluating three advanced AI-based models: LR CNN and KNN. The research 
utilises continuous air temperature data collected from a suburban region in Telangana, spanning from January 2023 to July 2024. 
Daily temperature values were aggregated by computing their mean for analysis. 
  <span class="more-text" style="display: none;">
    The performance of each model was assessed using 
key metrics, including accuracy percentage and MSE. Among the models, LR demonstrated the highest accuracy of 99.1% with an 
MSE of 0.06, followed by CNN with 98.4% accuracy and an MSE of 0.15. KNN achieved an accuracy of 97.3% with an MSE of 
0.55. The findings highlight LR as the most effective model for temperature prediction, showcasing its potential to improve weather 
forecasting systems. Detailed performance matrices and result plots for each model are presented, comprehensively evaluating their 
predictive capabilities. This study underscores the transformative impact of AI-driven approaches in advancing meteorological 
research and addressing real-world challenges, offering valuable insights for future applications in weather prediction.
